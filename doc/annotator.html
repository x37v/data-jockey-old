			<h1>Data Jockey: Annotator</h1>
			<p>
			Data Jockey includes an optional application 'datajockey_annotator'
			which is the start of a tag/descriptor editor for Data Jockey, that
			can be run without having to run the full Data Jockey application.
			</p>
			<p>
			Eventually this application will be more full featured, allowing users
			to visualize and edit beat location data, apply arbitrary descriptors,
			etc.  But the author finds it useful even in its present, less than
			fully-featured, state.
			</p>
			<p>
			In order to build the annotator, please consult the README.BUILD file
			in the main directory of the source code download.
			</p>
			<h2>Usage:</h2>
			<p>
			The annotator allows users to associate audio files [that have
			already been imported into the database] with tags.  It also allows
			users to apply a 'rating' to a work.  
			</p>
			<p>
			This 'rating' is an arbitrary numerical score of a song, which can be
			used however the user desires.  The author rates songs on a scale of
			one to five, where one means he doesn't like the song, two means it is
			'okay', three means the song is 'good', four means it is 'pretty darn
			good' and five means it is among his favorite songs.  The range is totally
			up to the user, it can include decimal places and could even be negative.
			</p>
			<h3>Graphical</h3>
			<p>
			By default the annotator will pop up a graphical display which shows
			the song database and tags and allows users to associate works with
			tags as well as create new tags.  New tag associations can be made by
			dragging tags from the main 'tag view' into the 'tag view' for a
			specific, selected song.  
			</p>
			<p>
			The screen shot, linked below, shows the
			main 'tag view' on the right and the details of the work 'Why Kill
			Time (When You Can Kill Yourself)' by 'Cabaret Voltaire' on the left.

			<h3>Command Line</h3>
			<p>
			There is a 'non-graphical' mode <span class="cli">--non-graphical</span>
			which allows users to apply tags and ratings without launching the
			graphical user interface.  Among other things, this is useful for
			applying ratings and tags while listening to music in some other audio
			application.
			</p>
			<p>
			See <span class="cli">datajockey_annotator -h</span> for information
			about the command line arguments.
			</p>
			<h2>Examples:</h2>
			<p>
			Here is an example which would rate the following song with a rating of 3.
			</p>
			<div class="cli">
			datajockey_annotator --non-graphical -r 3 music/eats_tapes/sticky_buttons-knightress.flac
			</div>

			<p>
			The following command would apply the tag 'hard' which has type 'heaviness' to the song.
			</p>
			<div class="cli">
				datajockey_annotator --non-graphical -t "hard","heaviness" /mp3/aphex_twin/classics/02-flaphead.flac
			</div>
			<p>
			The author uses <a href="http://moc.daper.net/">music on the
				console</a> to listen to music and has set up key bindings to rate
			songs while listening.  Below are the settings he uses in the '~/.moc/config' file:
<pre>ExecCommand1    = "datajockey_annotator %f"
ExecCommand5    = "datajockey_annotator -a -r 1 %f"
ExecCommand6    = "datajockey_annotator -a -r 2 %f"
ExecCommand7    = "datajockey_annotator -a -r 3 %f"
ExecCommand8    = "datajockey_annotator -a -r 4 %f"
ExecCommand9    = "datajockey_annotator -a -r 5 %f"</pre>
