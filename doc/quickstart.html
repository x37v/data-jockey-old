			<h1>Data Jockey: Quick Start</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<strong>Installation:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
					In order to build and install Data Jockey please reference the file
					"README.BUILD" which is included the Data Jockey source code download.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong>Importation:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Before actually using Data Jockey we must import some audio files into
					its database.  We use the command line application <a href="audio_import.html">datajockey_importer</a>
					for this.
					</li>
					<li>
					example: <span class="cli">datajockey_importer /path/to/audio_file.ogg</span>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong>DJ:</strong>
				Once we have imported some songs into the database we can use the
				main Data Jockey application.
				<a href="pics/screenshot.png">Click here</a> to view a screen shot of the main application.
				<ol>
					<li>
					Launch the application: <div class="cli">datajockey</div>
					<i>
						Sometimes you may have to launch jack externally before
						launching Data Jockey.  
					</i>
					</li>
					<li>
					Make sure you have the main outputs "output0" and "output1"
					connected to the outputs of your physical audio output device.
					(you can use jack_connect or qjackctl to do this).
					</li>
					<li>
					Select a work in the audio work database view ("work list" on the right).
					</li>
					<li>
					<img src="pics/load.png"> 
					Load the selected work into the first mixer by clicking the
					'load' button (displayed here) above that mixer channel. <i>(loading takes a few seconds)</i>
					</li>
					<li>
					<img src="pics/cue.png"> Click the cue button to make the audio go to the main outputs.
					</li>
					<li>
					<img src="pics/cue_off.png"> The cue button should now look like this.
					</li>
					<li>
					Select and load another work into the second mixer as you did above.
					</li>
					<li>
					Once you have selected the main outs for this mixer, by toggling the cue button as above,
					you should hear 2 songs that are playing in synch with each other.
					</li>
					<li>
					You can adjust the relative volumes of these songs by adjusting
					the slider in the appropriate mixer channel.
					</li>
					<li>
					You can adjust the global tempo by clicking the arrows on the
					tempo 'spin box' at the top right of the mixer panel.
					</li>
					<li>
					Explore!  
					<i>
						Most of the items in the mixer have tool-tips
						associated with them, so if you hover the mouse pointer over an
						item it should give you a short description of what it is.
					</i>
					</li>
