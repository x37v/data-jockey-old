			<h1>Data Jockey: Audio Import</h1>
			<p>
			Currently, the only way to play audio files with Data Jockey, is to
			first import them into the database.  To import audio files into the
			database we use the command line application 'datajockey_importer,'
			which is included in the Data Jockey download.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h2>Audio File Meta Data:</h2>
			'datajockey_importer' reads the meta-data embedded in audio files and
			uses that to built up the database (using song title, artist name,
			album name, and genre tags).  Make sure that your files are tagged
			correctly before the are imported.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h2>Beat Locations and Tempo Descriptors:</h2>
			'datajockey_importer,' by default, attempts to calculate the beat
			location information for each song it imports.  Data Jockey uses this
			information to synchronize a song with a master tempo clock.  This
			calculation takes some time and, if desired, can be disabled through
			the use of the command line argument '--no-beats'.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>NOTE</strong>: at the moment there is no easy way to compute
			the beat location and tempo information after the song has been
			imported into the database.  This will change eventually, but for now,
			if you are going to want to have Data Jockey synchronize your songs,
			make sure to have it compute the beat location information on import
			[the default].
			</p>
			<p>
			<h2>Spectral Descriptors:</h2>
			'datajockey_importer,' by default, also calculates some spectral
			descriptors for each song.  These calculations take some time and, if
			desired, can be disabled through the use of the command line argument
			'--no-descriptors'.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h2>Example:</h2>
			<p>
			The following command will attempt to import all of the audio files
			located in '~/music'.  The -r switch, 'recursive,' indicates
			that 'datajockey_importer' should search all of the directories below
			'~/music' for audio files.  The importer will then display all
			of the files it will attempt to import, ask the user if they wish to
			proceed, and if so, begin the importation process.
			</p>
			<div class="cli">datajockey_importer -r ~/music</div>
			<p>An example output follows:</p>
			<div class="cli-result">
<pre>files:
        /home/alex/music/dual-corporate_lies_and_deceit.mp3
        /home/alex/music/eats_tapes/sticky_buttons-knightress.flac
        /home/alex/music/solenoid-julys_war_butterflies.flac
        /home/alex/music/spk-slogun.flac
Importing the files listed above, continue? (yes/no)</pre>
			</div>
			<p>If the user wishes to continue they type yes[enter]:</p>
			<div class="cli">yes</div>
			<p>Then the importation begins, an example output follows:</p>
			<div class="cli-result">
				attempting import of /home/alex/music/dual-corporate_lies_and_deceit.mp3
				<br>success
				<br>attempting import of /home/alex/music/eats_tapes/sticky_buttons-knightress.flac
				<br>success
				<br>attempting import of /home/alex/music/solenoid-julys_war_butterflies.flac
				<br>success
				<br>attempting import of /home/alex/music/spk-slogun.flac
				<br>success

			See <span class="cli">datajockey_importer -h</span> for more information
			about the command line arguments.
