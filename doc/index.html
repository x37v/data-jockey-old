				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>
				Data Jockey is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS">FLOSS</a>
				project for digital djing.
				</p>

				<p>
				Data Jockey is largely centered around a database of music and
				information about this music.  The music is provided by the user.
				The information about the music is gathered from audio file meta
				data (information from id3 tags), computed through feature
				extraction techniques, and also provided directly by the user.
				</p>

				<p>
				Numerical data items, usually computed, are referred to as
				'descriptors'.  Textual data items, usually provided by the user,
				are referred to as 'tags'.  Tags allow users to provide their own
				organization schemes.  For instance, users may decide to associate
				songs with 'theme' tags.  These tags may indicate which songs have
				which themes.
				</p>

				<p>
				These tags and descriptors provide user of Data Jockey with several
				avenues for content retrieval.  The ultimate goal is to find music
				to include into a DJ mix.  Instead of simply searching for music
				based on the title, artist or album of a work, users can search for
				music based on qualities of the music itself.
				</p>

				<p>
				The Data Jockey user interface consists of a visualization of the
				user's music database and music meta-data and a audio mixer-panel
				like tool for combining works.  Data Jockey automatically tempo
				matches works which hopefully allows users to focus more on finding
				interesting juxtapositions than the technical elements of combining
				works.
				</p>

				<p>
				There are a few 'filters' provided which allow users to filter the
				works they view based on tags selected in a tag visualization, or
				based on the relationship between a song's original tempo and the
				current tempo of a mix.  Users will also be able to create custom
				filters which can react to the current state of a mix.  For
				instance, a user might have a filter which displays only works
				which have some tag or descriptor relationship with works which are
				currently audible in a mix.  Eventually I would like to keep a
				history of songs in a mix so that filters might react to more than
				just the current state, but also previous states.
