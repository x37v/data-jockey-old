			<h1>Data Jockey: Tags</h1>
			<p>
			Data Jockey allows users to associate songs in their database with
			arbitrary textual 'tags'.  Tags have a 'type', for instance 'genre,'
			or 'lyrical theme' and a value, like 'acid house,' or 'dancing.'
			</p>
			<p>
			'genre' tags are automatically extracted from audio files [if they
			have embedded 'genre' information] when users import their files into
			the database using <a href="audio_import.html">datajockey_importer</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Users can <a href="#filtering">filter</a> the view of the library
			through the user of tags.  Users can tag works in a variety of
			different ways, based on qualities of the works or simply based on
			some attribute that users which to associate with their works.  These
			tags and filter based on tags allow Data Jockey users to create their
			own, though somewhat basic, multi-layered organizational schemes.  
			</p>
			<a name="tagging">
			<h2>Tagging:</h2>
			<p>
			Users can create new tags and tag types in the 'tags' tab of the main
			application, or using <a href="annotator.html">datajockey_annotator</a>.
			The image below shows an example of a user creating a new 'language'
			tag with the value 'german.'
			</p>
			<p>
			<img src="pics/createtag.png">
			</p>
			<p>
			Users can then associate these tags with a particular work by
			selecting the work in the 'work list' and dragging/dropping the
			desired tag from the main 'tag list' into the 'tag list' associated
			with that particular work.  The image below shows a work that has just
			been tagged with the 'german' 'language' tag.
			</p>

			<h2>Filtering:</h2>
			<p>
			Once works have been associated with 'tags,' users can filter their
			'work list' to only display works with a specific tag.  This can be
			achieved by:
			<ol>
				<li>
				Selecting the "Tag Selection Filter" in the "filters" view
				of the main application.
				</li>
				<li>
				Selecting one or more tags in the "tags" view of the main
				application.  
				<i>
					More than one tag can be selected through the use of 'shift' +
					mouse click or 'ctl'+ mouse click.  'shift' + click selects a
					range.  'ctl' + click toggles the clicked item in/out of the
					selection.
				</i>
				</li>
				<li>
				Pressing "apply filter" on the "work list" view.
				</li>
			</ol>
