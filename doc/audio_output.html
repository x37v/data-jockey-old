			<h1>Data Jockey: Audio Output</h1>
			<div>
				<p>
				Data Jockey uses <a href="http://jackaudio.org/">Jack</a> for its
				audio output.  Jack allows Data Jockey's users to easily route
				their audio output in a variety of ways.
				</p>
				<p>
				There are currently 3 "audio outputs" for Data Jockey.  Two stereo
				outputs "output" and "cue" and one mono output "measure".
				</p>
				<p>
				Currently Data Jockey does not provide any way to manage Jack
				connections internally.  You can use the external applications <a
					href="http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net/">qjackctl</a> or
				jack_connect for that.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Cue vs. the Main Output</h2>
				<p> 
				Data Jockey's 2 stereo outputs both output the audio playback from
				Data Jockey.  The main outputs "output0" and "output1" are intended
				to be used as the primary listening output.  The "cue" outputs
				"cue0" and "cue1" are intended to be used to preview audio before
				it is output on the main outputs and presented to the audience.
				</p>
				<p>
				Each mixer has a 'cue' button which determines the output
				destination, "cue" or "output".
				</p>
				<p>
				<img src="pics/cue.png" alt="cue button in cuing state">  Here is
				the cue button in its "cueing" state.  The mixer associated with
				this cue button will be sending its audio to the "cue" outputs.
				</p>
				<p>
				<img src="pics/cue_off.png" alt="cue button in not cueing state">
				Here is the cue button in its "inactive", "not cueing" state.  The
				mixer associated with this button will be sending its audio to the
				main outputs.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Measure Output</h2>
				<p>
				The "measure" output is an audio rate ramp which counts from 0 to 1
				over 4 beats.  This allows users to synchronize external, jack
				enabled, applications, in tempo, with Data Jockey.  Eventually Data
				Jockey will provide other avenues for external synchronization.
