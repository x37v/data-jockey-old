	cannot seem to figure out which widget is displayed during this drag.
Synching:
	* Moving from 'sync' to 'free' mode doesn't work correctly when the master
	is in sync with a mixer and not running free.
	* Tracks are auto synced when they load, so even if you select 'run free'
	before the track is full loaded they will be in sync until you toggle 'sync'
	2 times.
